Game idea: A game based on the dinosaur game from Google.
Twist: The speed at which obstacles approach randomly changes and so does the speed of the jump. Also, obstacles can appear and disappear randomly.
Challenges:
    1. High-scores log;
    2. Obstacle generation;
    3. Speed control/chnages.
