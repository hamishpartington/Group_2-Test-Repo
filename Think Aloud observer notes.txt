Think Aloud observer notes

Player not sure what objective is nor how to play, as no instructions or start screen are presented.
There was no indication of which character/tank the player was controlling.
No indication of when the turn to play is switched to player 2.
Smoothness of the landscape seems to be good.
Recommended adding certain features to avoid cheating, such as ensuring player 1 cannot play for player 2.
Health bars good are a good feature.
Accidently pressed space bar too long which led to firing for opponent, which could be explored for cheating.
Adding physics that can impact how he game is played.
* Such as adding wind that can alter the angle of the missile being fired.
Need to implement more features that allow for strategic gameplay.
* E.g.: Having the high ground isn’t advantageous when it should be and could alter how players engage with the game.
Loop hole which allows cheating, namely when firing. 
* Possible solution is to use key release method instead of key pressed.
Add time limit for each turn, to avoid the game dragging for too long and to apply pressure to players.
